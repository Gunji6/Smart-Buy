# Smart-Buy
Smart Buy is a data-driven electronic device recommendation system designed to help customers make informed purchasing decisions. The project involves web scraping, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and statistical analysis to identify key influencing factors for personalized recommendations.

# Stages of Development
## 1. Data Collection and Preparation
- Web Scraping: Extracted product details from various e-commerce websites using BeautifulSoup and Regex.
- Data Cleaning: Removed null values, duplicates, and irrelevant columns to ensure high-quality data.
- Structured Dataset: Organized data into meaningful categories, including product specifications, user reviews, and pricing trends.

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Conducted an in-depth univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis using Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to uncover trends and relationships:
- Identified key influencing factors affecting purchase decisions.
- Analyzed correlations between product features and customer preferences.
- Visualized data distributions to gain deeper insights into consumer behavior.

## 3. Statistical Analysis
- Used SciPy for statistical testing and hypothesis validation.
- Conducted trend analysis and feature importance evaluation to identify patterns in consumer preferences.
- Applied correlation and regression techniques to determine the most significant factors influencing product selection.
